# 2D-Geometric-Visualizer

## Introduction
This project was mainly conceived to <b>study geometry through computer graphics</b>. The implementation involves a system for <b>visualizing simple geometric shapes and manipulating them</b>, including scaling, rotation, translation, and more. Everything is displayed through a simple GUI pyhton interface that allows users to <b>select</b>, <b>create</b>, and <b>delete</b> shapes on a centralized canvas.

## How it works
The system operates via interaction on a canvas, enabling users to 'draw' geometric shapes like <b>polygons</b> (with a defined number of points) and <b>circles</b>. These shapes can be manipulated using the following geometric transformations:

<ul>
    <li>Rotation;</li>
    <li>Scale Change;</li>
    <li>Zoom;</li>
    <li>Zoom Extend;</li>
    <li>Translation;</li>
    <li>Selection;</li>
</ul>

All functions were written in Python using libraries for <b>interface</b>, <b>arithmetic operations</b>, and <b>Os system functions</b>.

## How to use
<b>The 'Img' folder should be in the same directory as the code.</b>

### Interface

There is a <b>help menu</b> in the top left corner; everything is quite intuitive. In the upper right corner, there is a <b>box displaying the created shapes</b>, is possible to select the shapes either through this box or by clicking directly on them in the canvas.

### Dependencies
